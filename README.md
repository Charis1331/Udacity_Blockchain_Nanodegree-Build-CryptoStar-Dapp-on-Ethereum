# Udacity Blockchain Nanodegree - Build a CryptoStar DApp on Ethereum
In this project I built a smart contract, created a notary service, and deployed it on the Ethereum Rinkeby blockchain.

## Usage of  the CryptoStars DApp:
With this DApp you can:
* claim a star
* find a star that's been claimed
* exchange stars (two people can exchange their CryptoStar tokens)
* transfer a star
